1) Get API key for website (create free account)
https://optimistic.etherscan.io/

2) Develop an algorithm that can get all transactions until reaches MexC/BingX/UniSwap using a source wallet address and show this visually on a dashboard

Current code can get simple transactions and can visualize it on a development server using Flask. Need to use Python to run the code.

Need to handle these cases:
- Holders transfer to each other
- After completing one chain move to the next chain (using source wallet address
- Push to production
